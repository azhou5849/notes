\subsection{Mortality modifications}

Select and ultimate probabilities
\begin{itemize}
\item $\qx[k]{[x]+t}$ is the probability that someone who was issued a policy at age $x$ and is currently age $x + t$ will die in the next $k$ years
\item Similar bracket notation for $\ell$, $p$, etc.
\end{itemize}

Change in mortality over time
\begin{itemize}
\item $q(x,t)$ is the probability that in year $t$, someone at age $x$ dies within the next year
\item Relative change in mortality within the $t$-th year: $\varphi(x,t) = 1 - q(x,t)/q(x, t - 1)$
\item If $\varphi(x,t)$ is independent of $t$, write $\varphi_x$
\end{itemize}
