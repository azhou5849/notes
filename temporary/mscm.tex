\section*{Permutations}

\textbf{Definition:} The \emph{factorial} of a non-negative integer $n$ is defined recursively by
\begin{equation*}
0! = 1\quad\text{and}\quad n! = n\cdot (n - 1)!\text{ for all }n\geq 1.
\end{equation*}
When $n$ is a positive integer, $n!$ is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$, and it gives the number of orders in which $n$ distinct items can be listed. The first several values are
\begin{align*}
0! &= 1, \\
1! &= 1\cdot 0! = 1\cdot 1 = 1, \\
2! &= 2\cdot 1! = 2\cdot 1 = 2, \\
3! &= 3\cdot 2! = 3\cdot 2 = 6, \\
4! &= 4\cdot 3! = 4\cdot 6 = 24, \\
5! &= 5\cdot 4! = 5\cdot 24 = 120, \\
6! &= 6\cdot 5! = 6\cdot 120 = 720.
\end{align*}

\item The library is giving one book to each student for free. Three friends show up at the library and find that there are 4 different books available, with only one copy left for each of the books. In how many ways can the friends choose their books?\vspace{2cm}
\item How many positive 3-digit integers have 3 distinct digits?\vspace{2cm}
\item How many 4-digit \underline{odd} integers greater than 6000 can be formed from the digits $\{0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8\}$ if no digit may be used more than once?\vspace{2cm}
\item How many different 4-letter strings can be generated by using each of the letters $A$, $O$, $P$, and $S$ exactly once? (A \emph{string} in this context is a sequence of characters, such as $SOAP$. It need not be an actual English word, so for example, $SAOP$ would also be a valid string.)

\section*{Repeated Elements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item If all the letters of the word $SYZYGY$\footnote{``In astronomy, a roughly straight-line configuration of three or more celestial bodies.''} are used, in how many different ways can the six letters be arranged in a six-letter string?\vspace{4cm}
\item In how many different ways can the letters in the word $PEOPLE$ be scrambled, including the original spelling $PEOPLE$?\vspace{4cm}
\item (2006 State Sprint Problem 28) Derek's phone number, 336-7624, has the property that the three-digit prefix, 336, equals the product of the last four digits, $7\times 6\times 2\times 4$. How many seven-digit phone numbers beginning with 336 have this property?

\section*{Extra Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (\emph{Calculator permitted.}) Two positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + 4xy + 5y^2 - 14x - 32y + 52 = 0.
\end{equation*}
What is the maximum possible value of $y/x$? Round your answer to two decimal places.\vspace{3cm}
\item All 7-digit positive integers which have each of the digits from 1 to 7 (inclusive) exactly once are written in increasing order. What is the 2025th number in the list?\vspace{3cm}
\item In triangle $ABC$, points $P$ and $Q$ are the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on lines $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively, so that the areas of triangle $APQ$, quadrilateral $PQYX$, and quadrilateral $XYCB$ form an arithmetic sequence in that order. Find the ratio $XY/BC$, expressing your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\vspace{3cm}
\item If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers such that
\begin{equation*}
\gcd(a,b) = 12,\quad\gcd(b,c) = 45,\quad\gcd(c,a) = 21,
\end{equation*}
what is the minimum possible value of $a + b + c$?
