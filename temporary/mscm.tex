\section*{Game Time! Continued}

As a reminder, the game played at the start of class involves rolling a standard six-sided die with payouts according to the table below (not including initial cost to play).
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r||r|r|r|r|r|r}
Outcome & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline 
Payout & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 10 & 30
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
We found that the expected payout, i.e. the ``fair'' price for playing, is $20/3$ dollars.

Now instead, suppose the price for playing is set at \$7.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the expected value of the game master's profit each time the game is played?\vspace{1cm}
\item Lucas has \$100 to spend and decides to play the game repeatedly until they either make a net profit or is no longer able to play. Test this strategy several times, recording Lucas's net profit in each trial (positive or negative).\vspace{8cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In what fraction of your trials does Lucas make a net profit?\vspace{1cm}
\item What is Lucas's average net profit over all trials?\vspace{1cm}
\item (Open-ended) See what happens if they try a different strategy.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

% \section*{Repeated Elements}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item If all the letters of the word $SYZYGY$\footnote{``In astronomy, a roughly straight-line configuration of three or more celestial bodies.''} are used, in how many different ways can the six letters be arranged in a six-letter string?\vspace{4cm}
% \item In how many different ways can the letters in the word $PEOPLE$ be scrambled, including the original spelling $PEOPLE$?\vspace{4cm}
% \item (2006 State Sprint Problem 28) Derek's phone number, 336-7624, has the property that the three-digit prefix, 336, equals the product of the last four digits, $7\times 6\times 2\times 4$. How many seven-digit phone numbers beginning with 336 have this property?

\section*{Extra Problems ($\star$)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $A,B,C,D$ be integers and suppose
\begin{equation*}
x^4 + Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D = 0
\end{equation*}
when $x = 2^{1/4} + 2^{1/2}$. Compute $A + B + C + D$.\vspace{3cm}
\item For each positive integer $N$, let $P(N)$ be the probability that when a subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$ is selected uniformly at random, the number of elements in the subset is a multiple of 4. For how many positive integers $N\leq 2025$ is it the case that $P(N) = 1/4$?\vspace{3cm}
\item In triangle $ABC$, points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{AB}$, respectively. Lines $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{CF}$ intersect at $G$. If $\angle GBC = 60^{\circ}$ and $\angle GCB = 45^{\circ}$ and $BG = 4$, then what is $(BF)^2$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\vspace{3cm}
\item How many (non-congruent) right triangles are there in which:
\begin{enumerate}
\item one of the leg lengths is 2025 and the other two side lengths are positive integers?
\item the hypotenuse has length 2025 and the two leg lengths are positive integers?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
